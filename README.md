# SimulatedAnneling

Solving the 'Hundred-digit Challenge problem' 4. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred-dollar,_Hundred-digit_Challenge_problems This is an global optimization problem since the function has many local minima. The problem is solved using simulated anneling (Metropolis). A baysian optimizer is used for tuning the hyperparameters: step size and temperature.
